missing features:
-DAO pattern
-CRUD implementation
working currently in:
-trying to figure out the format
12:54 a.m
-it turns out that the format was given in the assigment
-I will try to firstly build the DAO structure, it should be a package of its own
-from the CRUD implementation I will start with the Create process, my first idea is to first place the button
on the main menu and from that figure out the DAO classes, so this approach towards the Creating process will
be used as template for the rest of the CRUD implementations and the DAO classes placement inside the project 
(later this idea was discarded, instead, the Creating and Reading process are automatic)

missing features:
-Updating and deleting process from CRUD implementation
working currently in:
-one of us finished the Reading and Creation process, so 
I will try to focus on the Updating process, especifically on how to modify the data,
my first proposal is to have a button that leads to a window that allows you to do so
