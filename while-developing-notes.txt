missing features:
-DAO pattern
-CRUD implementation
working currently in:
-trying to figure out the format
12:54 a.m
-it turns out that the format was given in the assigment
-I will try to firstly build the DAO structure, it should be a package of its own
-from the CRUD implementation I will start with the Create process, my first idea is to first place the button
on the main menu and from that figure out the DAO classes, so this approach towards the Creating process will
be used as template for the rest of the CRUD implementations and the DAO classes placement inside the project 
(later this idea was discarded, instead, the Creating and Reading process are automatic)

missing features:
-Updating and deleting process from CRUD implementation
working currently in:
-one of us finished the Reading and Creation process, so 
I will try to focus on the Updating process, especifically on how to modify the data,
my first proposal is to have a button that leads to a window that allows you to do so, I will try with to do it
so the user clicks modify

-I think it the way my teammate built the file-management could be improved, their approach involved spliting 
the data into several files, I think it would be better if it were a single document, I am aware that a
monolitic structure is the opposite from what we should use in OOP, but this very time it could be benefical,
but in case it does not work, I will be doing this in a separated branch

27/05/2025 5:57 p.m
-I noticed some issues with the file, manegement, short-long-history: the controller's constructor is built so it
repeats certain method that writes in the main file, I will work on that.


27/05/2025 6:02 p.m
-fixed the repeated-line-issue, but now I have noticed that the data in the file differs from the format given in the
assigment, I will add a class in the DAO package to manage better the data that is nedded, most of that will
come form the ticket

27/05/2025 11:37 p.m
-it took more time than expected, but at least I have the structure for the class that allows me to get 
the main file
-I am starting to realize that the Updating process is more implicit from what I expected, since the updating
of when does a vehicle leaves requires changes in the file, so what remains is adding a way to delete the info, I will work on that


28/05/2025 5:15 a.m
-I stumbled upon certain issues with the Updating process, it took more time than I expected (again), but this time for sure just
remains the Deleting process;
